# Differences with /TG/Station

The best practice to have while coding is to keep everything modularized, or the most possible. Sometimes it's not possible and you're required to put a "hook" proc call in a TG file. This file is intended to have a list of those hooks, so their locations and purposes can be easily found.

### PRs that includes a hook addition to a TG file and fail to update this list will not be merged.
